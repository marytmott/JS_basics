JavaScript Basic Concepts to Explain to Kids (age level: 5 and up)

Variable - A variable is like a box. It can store any value we want. We can have it store lots of values and we can change what the box stores.


Conditional - A conditional is what we use when we want to make a path for our JS program to go down. A conditional is like a fork in the road. When the program gets to a point where a conditional is, it has to figure out which road to take based on how the conditional is set up. The program can only go down one of the paths, even though there might be many to choose from.


Array - An array is a variable which we already talked about. This special type of variable can hold many things in it. They do not have to be the same type of thing, but we can put whatever we want in the array. When we define what an array is, we put the elements (one or more) inside braces like this -- [].


Object - Think of an object like an array, except an object likes to have pairs. We can store many things in an object and we use curly braces to hold all the things -- {}. When we say the object likes to have pairs, an object likes to have its elements hold hands with something to identify what the parts of it are. There are two parts we have to define each time we want to put something in the object. The first part is called the "key" and it like to hold hands with whatever value you want to give it. Each key has to be unique so we know how to access what it is holding hands with. The keys can hold hands with many things - arrays, objects, functions, variables, or whatever we want. When we want to get at an element in the object, we have to access it by telling it which key we want. Then we can find out what it is holding hands with.

Function - A function is the fun part of JavaScript. This is what makes JavaScript do things. A function has code inside of it and when we "call" the function, which means we make the program run, the function will do what it is programmed to do. Functions can be "called" to play a game, to calculate numbers for us, or whatever we want to program it to do.
